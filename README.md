# MScThesis-Prediction_of_FlowFields
This readme file is written to provide an overview of the stored documents in this Github repisotory.

The "CFD_Information directory" consists of:
- CFD Reports:                6 HMTL documents that summarize all the CFD settings
- CFL Karman:                 Courant number for operating point 1 and 13
- CFL Mixing Layer:           Courant number for operating point 1, the base case
- Mesh study Mixing Layer:    Minor mesh study performed for 3 different meshes
- Pope Karman:                Pope criteria for for operating point 1 and 13
- Pope Mixing Layer:          Pope criteria for operating point 1,2,4
- Probe Points:               Karman and Mixing Layer

The Karman_DoE_LES directory consists of:
- Pressure: 
    - GIFs:                  Total flow-field & Fluctuating flow-field
    - Figures:               Mean flow-field
